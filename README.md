# Node Server Boilerplate

This is a basic boilerplate for a Node.js server using TypeScript.

## Getting Started

1.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  Create a `.env` file from the `sample.env` file and fill in the required environment variables.
3.  Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Linting

This project uses ESLint and Prettier for linting and formatting.

-   To run the linter, use:
    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```
-   To fix linting errors, use:
    ```bash
    npm run lint:fix
    ```
